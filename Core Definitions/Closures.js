//Closures 


/*
Like most modern languages, Javascript uses Lexical scoping. What this will mean is that functions are executed using the variable scope the was in effect
when they were defined, not the variable scope in place when they are invoked. To implement lexical scoping the internal state of a function object include
not only the code of the function but also a reference to the current scope chain.
