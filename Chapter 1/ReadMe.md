Javascript is a programming language with a focus on web based development. 
The overwhelming majority of modern websites will use javascript, with all modern browsers on a range of devices from desktop to mobile phones. Will include a Javascript interpreter. Making javascript the most present (found everywhere) programming language in history.

When learning web development there is a triad of technolgies to learn; 
* HTML in order to specify the content of web pages 
* Css to specify the presentation of web pages
* Javascript to specify the behaviour of web pages 

Javascript is a;
* High Level; 

**The language is independent and can be used across varying devices and computers. Its ability to be used isnt limited. Examples
include C++, C#, Python, Swift etc**
The languages may use different syntax and have different base purposes such as some are used for desktop software programs
others for web development. They are considered high level as they must be processed by a compiler or interpreter before the code
is executed.
**Source code written in languages like C++ and C# must be compiled into machine code in order to run. The compilation process converts the human-readble syntax of the high-level language into low-level code for a specific processor. Source code written in scripting languages like Perl and PHP can be run through an interpreter, which converts the high-level code into a low-level language on-the-fly.** 

* Dynamic;

**The Language is type checked on the fly, this means it will only check the code which is to be excuted based on function calls, and conditional statements etc. There is also pre compiler situation, javascript isnt compiled it is interpreted. This means as its called to use the code will be interpreted again and again. Static Compiled code will experience all the code being excuted, looking for type errors
at this point rather than on each use.** 

* Untypes Interpreted Language 

* Suited to Object Orietnated and Functional Programming Styles

Javascript takes and insprires its syntax from Java, its first class function from scheme and its prototype based inheritence from self.

For everylanguage to be useful it must have a platform, or a standard library or API of Functions for performing things like basic input and output.

The core javascript defines a minimal API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions but does not include any input or output functionality.

The Input and output, aswell as other sophisticated features such as networking, storage and graphics is the responsibility of the host enviroment within the javascript is embedded. 
This host enviroment is usually the web browser.
